## How Templates Work

Each template is a structured markdown file that:
- **Defines the format** for specific types of business content
- **Includes placeholders** for dynamic information
- **Maintains brand consistency** across all AI-generated outputs
- **Provides context** about when and how to use the template

## Template Structure

Every template follows this structure:

```markdown
# [Template Name]

## Purpose
Brief description of what this template is for and when to use it.

## Context Requirements

## Using Templates with AI

When working with AI, reference templates like this:

```markdown
Use the [template-name] template to create [specific content type].
Include the following context:
- [Context item 1]
- [Context item 2]
- [Context item 3]
```

## Customization Guidelines

1. **Replace placeholders** with your company-specific information
2. **Adapt tone and style** to match your brand voice
3. **Add industry-specific elements** as needed
4. **Include compliance requirements** for regulated industries
5. **Test with AI** to ensure consistent, high-quality outputs

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **üìÅ Set Up Your Repository**: Clone this repository and organize your business-specific markdown files
2. **üè∑Ô∏è Define Context and Tags**: Use MCP to tag documents and establish AI behavior patterns
3. **ü§ñ Generate Content**: Let AI create business documents‚Äîfrom sales scripts to CEO announcements‚Äîthat align with your company's goals
4. **üîß Iterate and Refine**: Continuously improve your templates based on AI output and business feedback

## üí° Use Cases

### Dynamic Content Creation for Startups
Imagine you're a small startup needing consistent blog content and customer updates. Feed the AI markdown files containing your brand tone, recent product updates, and core messaging. The AI generates polished articles that sound authentically like your founding team‚Äîsaving time while maintaining consistency across all communications.

### AI-Powered Internal Documentation  
Tech companies struggle with keeping internal documentation current. Tag documents related to engineering practices, deployment procedures, and troubleshooting guides. The AI generates updated documentation reflecting latest changes in real-time, ensuring your team always has the most current information at their fingertips.

### Persona-Based Customer Interactions
Running a business with multiple customer-facing roles? Create markdown templates for different personas‚Äîsales agents, customer support reps, or even the CEO. The AI generates responses matching specific tones and guidelines for each role, making interactions more personalized and effective.

### MCP-Driven Automations
The Model Context Protocol enables nuanced control over AI behavior. By tagging documents with specific metadata, the AI intelligently switches between different tones, formality levels, or focus areas depending on the use case‚Äîfrom technical documentation to executive communications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Understanding Cursor v1 and MCP

**Cursor v1** represents a revolutionary leap in AI-powered development environments. At its core is the [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)‚Äîan open standard developed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) that standardizes how AI applications provide context and tools to Large Language Models.

## Why MCP is a Game-Changer for Business Operations

Imagine you have a brilliant business consultant who can write, analyze, and strategize‚Äîbut they're locked in a room with no access to your company data, tools, or current information. This describes most AI today: powerful but isolated. [MCP solves this fundamental problem](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/ai/mcp-explained/) by acting as a **"universal connector"** that allows AI to seamlessly access and interact with your business ecosystem.

**The Traditional Problem**: Before MCP, connecting AI to each business tool required custom code, special prompting, and fragile integrations. Want your AI to access customer data from your CRM? Custom integration. Pull financial reports from accounting software? Another custom solution. Read company policies from Notion? Yet another bespoke connector.

**The MCP Solution**: [As explained by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), MCP "provides a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol." Think of MCP as [**USB-C for AI applications**](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/mcp)‚Äîone standardized way to connect to everything.

## The Power of Markdown + MCP: Context Blending in Action

This handbook leverages a revolutionary approach: **structured markdown files + MCP integration**. Here's why this combination is transformative:

### 1. **Layered Context Architecture**
Your business context lives in multiple layers:
- **Static Context**: Brand guidelines, company values, communication styles (markdown files)
- **Dynamic Context**: Real-time data from CRMs, recent news, market updates (MCP servers)
- **Interactive Tools**: Ability to send emails, update databases, create documents (MCP tools)

### 2. **Intelligent Context Blending**
When you ask AI to "create a customer update email," the system automatically:
```markdown
# AI's Context Awareness Process:
1. Reads brand-voice.md (tone and style guidelines)
2. Accesses recent-updates.md (latest company news)
3. Queries CRM via MCP (customer-specific data)
4. Pulls market trends via MCP (industry context)
5. Generates personalized, on-brand content
6. Can send the email via MCP (if desired)
```

### 3. **Version-Controlled Business Knowledge**
Unlike traditional knowledge bases, your business context is:
- **Version-controlled**: Track changes to guidelines over time
- **Collaborative**: Teams can contribute and review updates
- **Portable**: Works across different AI platforms
- **Transparent**: See exactly what context influenced AI decisions

### 4. **Scalable Context Management**
As [noted by industry experts](https://medium.com/@tinholt/the-ai-game-changer-how-the-model-context-protocol-is-redefining-business-a50a7711ef8b), "MCP transforms AI from a passive tool into an active business driver." Your markdown files provide the foundation, while MCP connections enable real-time adaptation and action.

### MCP Architecture in Cursor

Cursor's MCP implementation uses a **client/server model** with three key components:

- **MCP Host**: Cursor IDE itself, containing orchestration logic
- **MCP Client**: Converts user requests into structured formats the protocol can process  
- **MCP Server**: External services (Slack, GitHub, databases) that provide context to the AI

Cursor supports **three transport types** for MCP servers:

| Transport | Environment | Deployment | Users | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------|----------|
| **stdio** | Local | Cursor-managed | Single user | Local development, simple tools |
| **SSE** | Local/Remote | Server deployment | Multiple users | Real-time data, distributed teams |
| **HTTP** | Local/Remote | Server deployment | Multiple users | Enterprise integrations |

### Prerequisites

- **[Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/)** with MCP support (latest version)
- **Git** for version control  
- **Node.js/Python** (for custom MCP server development)
- Basic familiarity with **markdown syntax** and **JSON configuration**

### Quick Start

#### 1. Clone and Set Up Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-ops-handbook.git
cd ai-ops-handbook
```

#### 2. Configure MCP Servers in Cursor

**One-Click Installation** (Recommended):
1. Open Cursor Settings ‚Üí **Features** ‚Üí **MCP**
2. Browse the [curated MCP server collection](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#one-click-installation)
3. Install popular servers with OAuth support for instant authentication

**Manual Configuration**:
Create MCP configuration files based on your needs:

**Project-Specific** (`.cursor/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "business-context": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@your-org/business-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "COMPANY_NAME": "YourCompany"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Global Configuration** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "web-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@smithery/cli", "run", "@mzxrai/mcp-webresearch", "--config", "{}"]
    },
    "notion-integration": {
      "command": "npx",

- **Let AI decide**: The agent automatically selects appropriate tools
- **Explicit requests**: "Use the web search tool to find..." 
- **Tool management**: Enable/disable specific MCP tools in settings

**Example Workflow**:
```markdown
# In Cursor Chat
Generate a customer update email about our new product launch, 
incorporating recent company news and maintaining our brand voice.

# AI will automatically:
1. Access brand-voice.md via MCP
2. Pull recent updates from your MCP-connected sources
3. Generate contextually-aware content
4. Maintain consistency across communications
```

#### 5. Advanced Configuration

**Environment Variables** for secure API management:
```bash
# .env file
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_xyz
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-123
COMPANY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

**Custom Business MCP Server** (Example in TypeScript):
```typescript
// business-context-server.ts
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "business-context",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

server.tool("get_brand_voice", "Retrieve current brand voice guidelines", {}, 
  async () => {
    // Return structured brand voice data
    return { content: [{ type: "text", text: brandVoiceContent }] };
  }
);
```

### Step 5: Create Custom MCP Servers

Build MCP servers for your proprietary systems:

```typescript
// custom-business-server.ts
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "your-company-context",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// Tool to get current company metrics
server.tool("get_company_metrics", 
  "Retrieve current business metrics and KPIs", 
  {
    metric_type: z.enum(["sales", "marketing", "support", "product"]),
    time_period: z.string().optional()
  },
  async (params) => {
    // Connect to your internal analytics/BI system
    const metrics = await getCompanyMetrics(params.metric_type, params.time_period);
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(metrics, null, 2) }]
    };
  }
);

// Resource for real-time company updates
server.resource("company://recent-updates", 
  async () => {
    // Pull from your internal systems
    const updates = await getRecentCompanyUpdates();
    return `# Recent Company Updates\n\n${updates.join('\n\n')}`;
  }
);
```

### Step 6: Implement AI-Driven Workflows

Create automated workflows that demonstrate AI's business value:

#### Automated Content Creation

# HR Onboarding Workflow Agent

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to implement an AI agent that automates employee onboarding workflows, documentation generation, and new hire communications using the AI Operations Handbook for consistent, personalized, and efficient onboarding experiences.

## Agent Configuration

### Core Function
**Automated Employee Onboarding & Integration Pipeline**

The agent orchestrates complete onboarding workflows from offer acceptance through 90-day integration, automatically generating personalized materials, scheduling activities, tracking progress, and ensuring compliance with company standards.

### Context Usage
```yaml
# Agent Context Configuration

  - contexts/company/README.md          # Company culture, values, and structure
  - contexts/processes/README.md        # HR processes and workflows
  - contexts/departments/employee-resources/ # HR policies and procedures

department_context:
  - hr-operations/                     # Core HR processes and systems
  - talent-acquisition/                # Hiring workflows and standards
  - learning-development/              # Training programs and resources
  - workplace-culture/                 # Company culture and values
  - ai-resources-management/           # AI integration and collaboration
```

### Template Integration
```yaml

        stakeholders=['manager', 'hr', 'buddy'],
        success_metrics=define_success_metrics(role, department)
    )
    
    # 9. Execute workflow
    workflow_execution = {
        'welcome_package_sent': send_welcome_package(employee_data, welcome_package),
